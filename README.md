# NewYork-City-Taxi-Data
In this project, I have used Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest data from Azure SQL Database into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). Once the data is landed in the lake, transform it via mapping data flows, data factory's native transformation service, and sink it into Azure Synapse Analytics.
